# Building High Performance Software Engineering Teams

_“When a leader embraces their responsibility to care for people instead of caring for numbers, then people will follow”_  — “Leaders Eat Last” Simon Sinek (2014)

# Flow
## Visualize all work in flight
- All work
  - Incoming
  - Active
  - Completed
- Avoid over-process
- Avoid absence of process

## Know where is working coming from
- Double-click into work that is unclear
- Look for the source of work requests
- Keep refining the method of work intake
- Minimize instances of “unplanned” work
## Steady direction at pace
- Pursue a finite set of measurable objectives at pace
- Avoid ‘max capacity’ plans
- Avoid frequent changes
- Work in small iterative sizes
## Where two or more are gathered
- Avoid single-threaded engineering
- Pairs design, iterate and review faster
- Individual engineers become attached

# Feedback
## Daily Looking for Problem Signals
- Shipping means it is time to operate
- Unexpected errors quickly add up
- Direct line for customer feedback
- Team dashboards monitor service health
## Establish an Andon Cord Culture
- See something, say something
- Celebrate blamelessness in raising issues
- Treat development blocking work in a similar way
## Importance of Team Retrospectives
- Hold a predictable schedule of retrospectives
- Foster a safe space for feedback
- Focus on actionable improvements within team control
## Performance Goals: The needs of the many outweigh…
- Individuals create goals that map to team improvement
- “As an engineer, I will… conduct timely reviews, participate in paring sessions, provide mentoring to junior members…”
- Learning plan includes sharing or applying the new skill
- “When I study a new skill, I will apply the skill in context with the work of my team…”
- Measure results using peer feedback

# Continuous Improvement
## Delegating the Technical Expertise
- Build your Tech Leads
- Stay up-to-date with your own training
- Review the work of the team and ask questions
## Develop an internal culture of Mentoring
- Mentor creates the space for the mentee to learn best
## Make continuous training non-negotiable
- Predictable schedule of learning time
- Protect learning time in the schedule
## Amplifying problems and using Slowification
- Emphasizing improvement through slowing down
- Making the issue known
- Allocating time and resources to fix the problem
- Integrating the solution across the organization
